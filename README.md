Code repository for cmsc 828i final paper- How Low Resource Can You Go? Unsupervised Morphological Segmentation of Lishan Didan

#### Abstract

There are over 7000 spoken languages in theworld today, but many of them quickly and quietly disappearing. These invisible languages often have little to no digital presence; there is no data totrain an NLP model on. This paper explores morphological segmentation on one such language, Lishan Didan, with minimal curated data. This paperdocuments the first public attempt to our knowledge to train anNLP-related model on Lishan Didan, andone the very first attempts for any of the Neo-Aramaic languages. We gather and create data to curate a small, linguistically accurate dataset, which is then usedto train state of the art morphological segmentation models. This paper demonstratesthat with a dedicated effort, there may be hopeto adapt MLP techniques to many of the worldâ€™s invisible languages; however, italso reveals that we have still got a frustratinglylong way to go on the relatively "simple"task of unsupervised morphological segmentation.
